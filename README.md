# Movie-Indexer

We are excited to tell you about the application my team and I made using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, APIs from OMBD movies, and a Bootstrap alternative known as Materialize. Our application is designed to provide users with an easy and efficient way to search for information about their favorite movies.

## Description

With the help of HTML and CSS, we created a clean and user-friendly interface that allows users to search for movies using a simple search bar. We also used Materialize, which is a CSS framework that provides a modern and responsive design.

JavaScript played a crucial role in our application as we utilized it to interact with the OMBD API. This allowed us to fetch movie data from the API and display it on our application in an organized manner. With the help of JavaScript, we were able to create dynamic elements that update as the user types their search query.

The OMBD API was a valuable resource that allowed us to access detailed information about movies, such as the plot, release date, and cast. We incorporated this information into our application, making it easy for users to get a comprehensive overview of the movie they are interested in.

Overall, our application is a powerful tool that simplifies the movie-searching process for users. With the help of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the OMBD API, we were able to create a seamless user experience that provides movie enthusiasts with everything they need to know about their favorite films.
