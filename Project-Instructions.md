## Overview

Welcome to Project 1! This is an important step in your full-stack journey as you will now use your newly acquired skills and knowledge to build web application from scratch. With your team, you will conceive and execute a design that solves a real-world problem by integrating data received from multiple server-side API requests. Because you will be working collaboratively, you will learn agile development methodologies and implement feature and bug fixes using the git branch workflow and pull requests.

## Key Topics

- Server-side APIs
- Git branching workflow
- Agile software development

## Comprehension Check

You will be employer-ready if you can answer the following questions:

1. What is agile software development?
2. What is an MVP?
3. If you pull down a teammate's branch and you have merge conflicts, how do you handle it?

## Learning Objectives

You will be employer-competitive if you are able to:

- Speak technically about a feature you implemented in your project
- Explain and execute git branching workflow in a collaborative project
- Resolve merge conflicts
- Explain agile software development
- Design, build, and deploy a client-side web application using GitHub Pages
- Prepare a professional presentation and repository README for your project

Your project should fulfill the following requirements:

- Must use a CSS framework other than Bootstrap

- Must be Deployed (GitHub Pages)

- Must be interactive (i.e: accept and respond to user input)

- Must have User Input Validation

- Must use at least two server-side APIs

- Must have some sort of repeating element (table, columns, etc)

- Does not use alerts, confirms, or prompts (use modals).

- Must utilize at least one new library or technology that we havenâ€™t discussed

- Must have a polished frontend / UI

- Must meet good quality coding standards (indentation, scoping, naming)

- Use client-side storage to store persistent data.

- Be responsive.

- Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.).

- Must utilize Git Branching / Merging. Git Branches based on Feature Built / GitHub Project Card, minimum of 30 meaningful commits per contributor.

- Have a quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).

## Presentation Requirements

Use this [project presentation template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Y4ROswmKLgKzBQcAp5ZaYDjx2eALETuXmnwUjcO6byc/edit?usp=sharing) to address the following:

- Elevator pitch: a one minute description of your application

- Motivation for building this w/ Research you did: Into existing apps how is this different how is this the same?

- Concept: What your user story? What was your motivation for development?

- Process: What were the technologies used? How were tasks and roles broken down and assigned? What challenges did you encounter? What were your successes?

- How did you build it out? w/ Infographic of your work-flow

- Task Assignment => Who did what?

- Team work-flow => Working Agreements Stand-ups Playbacks

- User Stories => Features => task => Branches => Git Commits

- Planning Wireframe w/ Side by Side of initial Wireframe vs. end product

- Description of what it does w/ Visual Support: Gif / Image of your app doing it.

- User Stories w/ Gif of your application UI completing that user story

- API Researchâ€¦.

- Demo: Show your stuff!

- Directions for Future Development

- Links to the deployed application and the GitHub repository
